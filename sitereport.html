 <h1 style="color:red;font-size:40px;">problems doing in html and css </h1>
  <p style="color:pink;"> TO be honest and truth  i really  had a lot of issue when i first started html and css,   were really difficult for me to hold the concepts. Because I didn't grasp the tag and attributes,coding in html and css was difficult for me. i used to forget the most basics tags ,such as missing encoding,attributes,and so on. it was extremely difficult for me to create a basic html and css page .i learned some tags when doing html and css .When I first started coding and debugging,I had a lot of issues,such as forgettung the important tags in html and css. Debugging is the one of the things that comes after html and css coding.Debugging was also a difficult task. However,it was a fantastic learning experience.
